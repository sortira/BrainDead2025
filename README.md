## PS1
Model Link - the actual weights of MLPClassifier (use scikit-learn) are [here](https://github.com/sortira/BrainDead2025/blob/main/PS1/fine_tuned_MLP_model.sav)
### How is it structured

#### Most importantly, there is one notebook which contains the links to the two notebooks one for EDA one for ML Model as Google Colab Links. This is because the Plotly plots don't show in .ipynb uploaded to Github for some reason we don't know.

- there are 2 notebooks one for the prediction model other for the EDA questions.
- the report is added as a pdf
- file specific instructions are in a readme inside the directory
