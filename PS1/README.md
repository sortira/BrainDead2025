# Since we have carefully crafted Interactive Plots to make the Data Visualization hassle-free, a single Jupyter notebook is too big to be displayed directly on Git Hub. The platform is omitting all the plots and the notebooks only display the code blocks. Since it is not beneficial for anyone to download and run the Jupyter Notebooks locally, we have devised a way to make the Data Analysis process smoother for the viewers. 
# We have made a separate (bytes-wise tiny) `GitHub_notebook.ipynb` file which contains links to both the `IPL_Analysis_2025.ipynb` file & `IPL_Winner_Prediction.ipynb` file
# Viewers will find it easier to Visit the links and wait for the Notebooks to load (It takes a few minutes).
